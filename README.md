# baidu-dl

It is for extracting high speed download links from pan.baidu.com.

## Important Notes

The [old baidudl extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/baidudl/mccebkegnopjehbdbjbepjkoefnlkhef) is not maintained by me. And it has been found to be modified to be a **malicious extension** which will use your facebook token to do something unknown. If you are not sure about which version you are using, please reinstall the extension.
